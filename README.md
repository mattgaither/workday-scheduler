# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Desription
This is a work day scheduler. You can add comments on each hour if you need help remembering to do something or just to keep you on task. If you add a comment or task you can save the task with the blue button. I have made this to go from 6 am to 8 pm because I work 10 hour shifts that can vary day by day. Every hour I am at work I am assigned a task to do each hour and now I can log this and have the page show me what is coming up. 

This page will show you the date at the top and every hour that goes by the page will stay updated. If the event is in the past the color will be gray, if the event is now the color will be red, and if the evern is now the color will be green.
